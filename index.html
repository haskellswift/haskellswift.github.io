<h1>Manifesto of HaskellSwift</h1>

<p>I am an iOS programmer. I read books and chat with all kinds of people when I have time. I don’t think I belong to iOS community, fortunately I found a slight hope in Functional Programming(FP) community though. </p>

<p>After struggling with many difficulties to fight myself, I made a very difficult decision. Since there are so many iOS programmers, I would rather not go with the flow. I decided to develop a language / framework which is so difficult for most of iOS programmers to learn or use. Simply put, even if it did nothing but keep the substandard iOS programmers out, that in itself would be a huge reason to use this language/framework, HaskellSwift.</p>

<p>HaskellSwift is a functional language/framework. It would give hope to desperate functional programming programmers who want to enter the terrain of iOS development. It’s the lighthouse that FP programmers with advanced mindsets in the far future to replace the primitiv iOS programmers in Stone Age. If any iOS experts are willing to turn, I would welcome you guys to be turned if you guys are fearless to the difficulties of the mindset transition. HaskellSwift would higher barriers to entry of using it to develop iOS apps. It would eliminate chances of using HaskellSwift to bring creativity by substandard programmers.</p>

<p>Game On.</p>
